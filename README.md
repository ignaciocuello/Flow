# flow

**Flow is a deep, fast-paced game that allows players freedom of movement as far as their skill is able to take them.**

- **The premise is simple, just hit the key into the lock to progress onto the next level.** :key: :unlock:

- **However you must not let the key touch the *orange stuffâ„¢*, or else the key will despawn.** :x:

- **Things get a bit more interesting once you start adding more keys to the mix.** :key::key:

- **Oh... you can also wall jump by the way.**

- **Once we add that, we can start to have a little more fun. Complete levels as fast as possible to earn more cash.** :dollar:

- **Levels flow seemlessly into one another while progressively increasing in difficulty.**

- **Once you're finished you must hide away your cash ... and you're off to your next heist.** :money_with_wings:

- **The only thing limitting your speed is yourself, go back to older levels and blaze through them with your improved skills.** :clock1:

Flow was originally made in 2018.

note: I've only included the C# files in the repository as the project takes too long otherwise to upload. The assets I've left out are not programming related (mainly art assets).
